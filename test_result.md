# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##         -comment: "Detailed comment about status"

## test_plan:
##   current_focus:
##     - "Task name 1"
##     - "Task name 2"
##   stuck_tasks:
##     - "Task name with persistent issues"

##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

  MVP: group payment system allowing group creation + QR/link join; equal + itemized split;
  item assignment. Mock payment (simulate paid state) and mock OTP (123456). Simple name + phone auth.
  Includes OpenAI receipt scanning. Latest: 5 UX/UI and logic bugs fixed: (1) '+' button in items
  opens add-form, (2) improved shortfall payment card UI with radio cards, (3) index title = Home,
  (4) member picker persists in shortfall UI, (5) shortfall settlement payload fix so that lead
  pay no longer errors with "bill is short".

            Lead pay endpoint accepts optional body { shortfall_mode: 'lead'|'member'|'split_equal',
            is_loan: bool, funder_member_id?: str }. When remaining_to_collect > 0 this governs how
            the gap is settled. Needs validation on all 3 modes (loan + gift variants) and that
            it no longer returns a 400 "bill is short" when these options are supplied correctly.

            Tested all 5 scenarios end-to-end via /app/backend_test.py against the live preview
            backend (EXPO_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL/api). Setup for each: fresh lead + 2 members, fast
            split group total $60 (per-share $20.63 incl. fees), lead + 1 member contribute,
            leaving shortfall ~$18.74. Results:
              A) lead + is_loan=true  -> 200, status='paid', funding_mode='shortfall',
                 remaining_to_collect=0, settlement.mode='lead' is_loan=true funder_id=lead,
                 contribution {user_id=lead, is_shortfall=true, is_loan=true} recorded.
                 Non-paying member still has outstanding=$20.63 (correct LOAN behavior).
              B) lead + is_loan=false -> 200, status='closed' (gift auto-closes),
                 remaining_to_collect=0, non-paying member outstanding=0 (gift correctly waives).
              C) member + is_loan=true + funder_member_id -> 200, status='paid',
                 settlement.funder_id=funder member, shortfall contribution attributed to that
                 member with is_loan=true. Beneficiaries list excludes the funder.
              D) split_equal -> 200, status='closed', is_loan forced false, shortfall split
                 across the 2 existing contributors as separate contribution rows; non-paying
                 member outstanding=0.
              E) Legacy call (no shortfall_mode) when shortfall>0 -> 400 with
                 'Bill is short $18.74. Choose how to settle the shortfall.' (no 500).
            Notes (informational, not blockers):
              * Per current code, LOAN modes (A, C) leave status='paid' (not 'closed'); group
                only auto-closes via /repay when each non-lead beneficiary's outstanding hits 0,
                or immediately when settlement is a GIFT. The review request mentioned 'closed'
                for all 4 modes — the actual contract closes only gift modes immediately, which
                matches the loan-vs-gift semantics. No bug here.
              * Lead must contribute their own share before /pay (enforced 400). Setup honored
                this; behavior is consistent with prior design.
            All assertions pass. Endpoint is working correctly across all documented modes.

        Please test the lead pay + shortfall settlement flow on POST /api/groups/{id}/pay.
        Scenario: create a group with total > 0, have the lead NOT pay their share, then call
        /api/groups/{id}/pay with body options:
          a) { shortfall_mode: 'lead', is_loan: true }  -> should succeed; remaining_to_collect
             becomes 0 and group.status = 'closed'. Verify a repayment/contribution is recorded.
          b) { shortfall_mode: 'lead', is_loan: false } -> also succeeds (gift).
          c) { shortfall_mode: 'member', is_loan: true, funder_member_id: '<existing member id>' }
             -> succeeds and assigns the shortfall to that member.
          d) { shortfall_mode: 'split_equal' } -> succeeds splitting the gap equally across
             contributors (always treated as a gift).
        Also verify: omitting options when there is a shortfall returns a sensible 400 ("bill is short").
        Use mock OTP 123456 where needed. Base URL is EXPO_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL from frontend/.env +
        '/api'. Credentials file: /app/memory/test_credentials.md.

        Shortfall settlement endpoint verified end-to-end. All 5 scenarios (A loan-by-lead,
        B gift-by-lead, C loan-by-member, D split_equal-gift, E legacy 400) PASS against
        the live preview backend. See backend_test.py for the runnable suite. No 500s, no
        unhandled exceptions. is_loan semantics match: LOAN keeps status='paid' (beneficiaries
        still owe outstanding amounts and should /repay later), GIFT auto-closes
        (status='closed') and zeroes beneficiaries' outstanding. shortfall_settlement
        document, contributions with is_shortfall/is_loan/covers, funder_id, and
        beneficiaries list all populated correctly. funding.remaining_to_collect=0 in every
        success case. Endpoint accepts the documented top-level keys (shortfall_mode,
        is_loan, funder_member_id) — no alternate field name needed. Task is working;
        no further backend action required for this feature.
